Hey, I'm Samyok!

You're probably here to see my past projects, or perhpas my resume.

I'm currently a freshman at the University of Minnesota, where I am studying Computer Science and Mathematics.

I took a gap year after high school to live in NYC! I worked at [Fiveable](https://fiveable.me) as a full-time
software engineer. 

Last summer, I also directed [Dakota Debate Institute](https://dakotadebate.org)! We had over 45 students from five 
states attend a week-long debate camp.

## The Typewriter Effect
The typewriter effect is mostly handled by the [AnimatedText](./components/animatedText.js) component I wrote. 
It's a pretty basic, but you can use it on your own websites :)


## Run the Project
First, run the development server:

```bash
# First, install dependencies
yarn # or npm install

# Then run
yarn dev # or `next dev` or `npm run dev`
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
